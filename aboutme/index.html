  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Tyler Ward. I’m currently studying Computer Science at BYU-Idaho.</p>

  <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, playing video games, spending time with my daughter. I’m also passionate about anything that challenges my mind. I’m excited to be learning more about web development as part of a career shift or to expand my skills.</p>

  <p>I’ve been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was born, and one of my favorite quotes is: “In the strength of the Lord, I can do all things.” - President Russell M. Nelson.</p>

  <p>I’m excited to be in this class and looking forward to connecting with all of you!</p>
